# community-web is Wezer front-end dedicated to odoo cooperation tools

WeZer is an open source cooperation platform built to make businesses and communities more effective. It is a product of Valeureux, “The
Factory of Common goods Wealth Actualisation Tools”, which is studying, designing and teaching for many years about cooperation and sharing value.

As a software product, WeZer aims to bring many tools normally found separately into one environment, where they will be more effective, more
integrated, and easier to use. As a platform, and a distribution of Odoo (ex Open ERP), anyone is invited to contribute plugins. As a tool, WeZer supports the latest
thinking in organisational management and collective intelligence. WeZer is more than a tool, it’s a full device composed by a web app, an
‘implementation journey’, a community and a research program. WeZer is a systemic solution to boost cooperation, to dynamise the We!
